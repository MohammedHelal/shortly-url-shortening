## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The layout was interesting to work with it gave me trouble at first, but I really got to explore the fetch API with this project.
I have used it a few times before but i took this opportunity to really learn it and try out different apis.

This was a fun project
